# This is the main program file

# initializing 

# start for loop 
    #1) calcylate accleration at current time step i 
            # - thrust 
            # - gravity 
            #- drag

            # f = ma 
    
    #2) velocity at time step i+1/2 
    # v(i+1/2)  = a + dt/2 

    #3) position at full timstep i + 1 
    # x(i+1) = x(i) + v(i+1/2)*dt

    #4) re calculate acceleration at timestep i + 1 

    #5) get velocity at timesteip i + 1
