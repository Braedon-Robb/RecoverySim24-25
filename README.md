This repository predicts the apogee of a model rocket! 

## Repository Structure 


## Math Overview 


## Usage 

As a suggestion, it may be useful to create a file for each motor 

### 1. Create the data file containing the thrust + mass flow rate information 

To get started, download your rocket motor's thrust curve as a CSV file. 

### 2. Running the main simulation
