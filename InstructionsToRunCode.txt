Requirements:

Setup
1. Create a virtual environment: * make sure you are in the RecoverySim24-25 folder

python -m venv venv

2. Activate it:

Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
Mac:
source venv/bin/activate

3. Install dependencies: * only first time

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. now use this line to run a file:  * the first time you run a file in the venv may take some time

python3 <filename>
 * replace <filename> with something like thrustCurve.py

Tip: If that does not work try 

python <filename>

Every time you want to run files after dont forget to do step 2 to activate your venv.
Then you may run files as step 4 says
